As this group stabilized, complaints from our internal customers diminished by 75%. This was done through open communication of the down stream issues with internal customers and a \""Go and See\"" technique so the foreman who performed the unacceptable work could understand how their error effected down stream operations. Using this technique, coupled with a more clear understanding of quality procedures, quality performance improved greatly saving thousands of hours of unnecessary rework. Highlighting safety as the most important thing we do as a Leadership Team and working with my direct reports, we managed to create a safer, cleaner and more organized environment, reducing accidents by 50 % in the first year.
