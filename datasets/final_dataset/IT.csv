I was a visionary in regards to technical business operations, responsible for providing professional staff at various locations with efficient, up-to-date, secure and stable voice and data communications on a daily basis within budget. The ability to use good judgment, proven technologies and industry standards to balance ease of use with security. I am a fast paced leader with the patience to oversee the maintenance of existing systems while at the same time plan the implementation of new technologies in a cost efficient and timely manner. I am both a professional team leader and player that has directly managed a staff of seven information technical professionals as well as participating in many project implementation teams and initiatives. I am experienced in many of the technical methods, tools and applications used in business operations with the ability to connect multiple offices with highly secure and redundant Internet connections. While at the firm I was able to receive better than competitive pricing for the circuits due to the quantity of services required as well as my vendor negotiation skills. I have the technical knowledge and experience required for the strategic planning and funding of annual and multi-year business operations. My efforts have resulted in a direct costs savings in business operations. Most recently, we implemented user provided smart phones and free apps to provide efficient digital dictation and provided mobile capability to access our document management system. I have a dedicated work ethic that is required to oversee day-to-day technical business operations updating and upgrading systems in use while at the same time implementing new systems: Upgraded the firms bread-n-butter time and billing financial system several times. Upgraded the Word Perfect Application Suite to the Microsoft Office 2000 Suite. Upgraded Microsoft Office 2000 Suite to the Microsoft Office 2007 Suite. Upgraded the Group Wise Messaging to Outlook Messaging. Upgraded the Worldlox document management system to Worldox GX3. Upgraded the Audix voice messaging to Mutare voice messaging. Assisted the Marketing department to implement a firm wide Client Relationship Management (CRM) system. Setup up Voice Over Internet Protocols (VOIP) systems at two regional offices.

Implemented several mobile applications on attorney personal devices to improve efficiency (VPN connectivity, RDP clients, Dictate digital dictation, Dropbox, Microsoft Office Mobile Suite of applications, Linkedin, Business Card Scanner, Twitter, etc.) The firm experienced minimum unplanned system downtime under my watch and my team and I oversaw and provided training on the many various applications, processes and procedures used in business operations. I am an experienced data security officer with the skills and knowledge to ensure data is adequately protected. I was the firm's Security Officer and developed the technical security systems and procedures used in business operations. It was an interesting responsibility due to the challenges with balancing \""ease of use\"" while ensuring system and data \""security.\"" Every year my team and I would oversee a mandatory HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) Program Review. Every other year my team and I would facilitate a system wide vulnerability audit that included social engineering and vulnerability testing techniques.

I appreciate the resources, processes and procedures required to ensure system efficiency and readiness. At the firm most applications are hosted at the central office with the regional offices connecting with redundant Ethernet connections, this saves on the cost of having data centers and support staff at each firm location. My team and I have also authored the firm's business/continuity/disaster recovery plan for IT applications and systems.
